# Applied Microcontroller Programming (AÎ¼CP)
Applied PLC's Technique, Concept, and Function to Microcontroller is named "Applied Microcontroller Programming" and shared my Libraries "MicroBeaut" with you.
## Function List: 
### Timer: 
-	Debounce
-	TimerOn (Timer On) 
-	TimerOff (Timer Off) 
-	TimePulse (Time Pulse) 
-	Blink
-	Trigger
### Bistable:
-	SR (Set Dominant) 
-	RS (Reset Dominant) 
-	Toggle 
### Edge: 
-	Rising (Rising Edge) 
-	Falling (Falling Edge) 

All of them are generic functions that can help you do Microcontroller Programming efficiently. 

A Timer Group used "micros()" of Arduino function for calculating elapsed time. As I call " Continuous" tasks, you can use them for multitasking programs. Still, don't forget a delay() function; you may sometimes require to use it as an initiative of some process.

A Bistable and Edge Group are essential functions to detect or turn bit On/Off. Without thinking about managing their program, you can use these libraries in your program.

I hope you will enjoy Microcontroller Programming and hope these libraries may help you manage your program easily.
